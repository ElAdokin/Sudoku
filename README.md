## 🧩 Building the Game

This project is set up for Unity. To build the WebGL version:

1.  **Install Unity Hub** and make sure you have a compatible version of Unity Hub and Unity Editor installed (check the Unity version requirement in the project settings if unsure).
2.  Open this repository in the Unity Hub or open the project folder in the Unity Editor.
3.  Go to `File > Build Settings`.
4.  Select `WebGL` as the target platform.
5.  Configure your WebGL build settings (API, scripting backend, etc.) if needed.
6.  Click `Build and Run`.

Alternatively, you can just click `Build` and place the resulting `.unitypackage` or `.unityproject` (if you want to open it) in the Unity Hub to start the build process.
